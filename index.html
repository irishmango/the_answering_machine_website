                    struggles
                    beneath
                    the weight of her
                    family’s
                    expectations, the unforgiving demands of the opera world, and the darkness festering within her own
                    psyche. What begins
                    as a pursuit of perfection becomes a harrowing descent into fear, self-doubt, and fractured
                    identity. As
                    her sense of
                    reality unravels, music — once her refuge — morphs into both her torment and salvation.</p>

                        José Cortes’s The Answering Machine opens like a confessional whispered into the dark. It
                        invites us
                        into the quiet ache
                        of a life once filled with applause—a German opera singer, trapped between the grandeur of her
                        art
                        and the silence of
                        her home. What follows is not merely a film, but a recital of vulnerability, an aria of pain,
                        and,
                        ultimately, a
                        reclamation of self. The premise is deceptively simple: a woman, haunted by expectation. The
                        expectations of her family.
                        The demands of the opera world. The unrelenting standard she has built within herself. And yet,
                        in
                        the stillness of her
                        domestic solitude, something unravels—and something else begins to mend. Cortés films this
                        transformation with intimacy.
                        The camerawork is assured, the editing taut. Each cut lands like a breath between phrases of
                        music.
                        Yet there is an
                        unmistakable theatrical quality to it all—The Answering Machine often feels like a filmed
                        monodrama,
                        a stage performance
                        translated into cinema. This isn’t a flaw so much as a choice; the boundaries between theatre
                        and
                        film blur, creating a
                        hybrid space where performance and confession become one. At the center of it all stands Ivon
                        Mateljan, and she is
                        extraordinary. Her singing is exquisite, but it’s her silence that devastates. She wears her
                        fragility like an
                        aria—controlled, expressive, utterly human. The camera adores her not for her perfection, but
                        for
                        her willingness to
                        crumble before it. Few performances dare to be this naked. What begins as a story of failure
                        becomes
                        something far more
                        resonant: the courage to start again. Cortés doesn’t offer easy catharsis or melodrama. Instead,
                        he
                        gives us a portrait
                        of quiet reinvention, where art becomes a mirror for pain—and a passage through it. By the end,
                        The
                        Answering Machine
                        leaves us not with applause, but with a kind of reverent silence. The performance is over, but
                        the
                        echo remains.

                        Cortés’s premise is spare — a woman, an empty home, and the echoes of what was — yet within this
                        austerity he locates
                        something vast and symphonic.
                        <br>
                        Each gesture, each pause, feels choreographed to the rhythm of loss. The film becomes less a
                        narrative than a
                        composition: a cinematic sonata in minor key, written for light, breath, and the trembling of
                        human
                        will. Cortés’s
                        direction balances the cerebral and the sensual with remarkable poise. His camera neither
                        intrudes
                        nor embellishes; it
                        watches, almost reverently, as the performer slowly sheds her mask—her art and her suffering
                        merging
                        into one. The
                        editing is musical — cuts arrive like inhalations between verses, allowing emotion to resonate
                        in
                        the air.
                        <br>
                        There is a deliberate theatricality here, as if the frame itself were a proscenium arch; but
                        instead
                        of distancing us,
                        it transforms the screen into an intimate confessional where performance and truth become
                        indistinguishable. Ivon
                        Mateljan’s portrayal is nothing short of alchemical. Her face becomes a terrain of
                        micro-expressions, every flicker of
                        doubt or resignation caught in chiaroscuro light.
                        <br>
                        Beneath its minimalist exterior, The Answering Machine is a meditation on the existential cost
                        of
                        artistry. Cortés
                        refuses sentimentality; he offers, instead, revelation. The film suggests that creation is not
                        simply an act of
                        expression, but an act of endurance — a way of surviving the silence after the curtain falls. In
                        that silence, Cortés
                        achieves what few filmmakers dare: he transforms solitude into symphony.
